# ThematicDeductor

A Python notebook for advanced qualitative analysis of academic papers extracted as CSV from Scopus, focusing on semantic grouping of keywords and subsequent deductive analysis of titles and abstracts.

## ðŸŒŸ Overview

`ThematicDeductor` offers a novel approach to qualitative analysis in bibliometrics. Unlike tools that primarily focus on co-occurrence networks or descriptive statistics, this notebook empowers researchers to:

1.  **Semantically Group Similar Keywords:** Identify underlying concepts and themes by intelligently grouping related keywords extracted from your Scopus dataset.
2.  **Conduct Deductive Analysis:** Use these semantically grouped keywords as a basis for performing systematic deductive analysis across all paper titles and abstracts within your CSV, allowing for deeper qualitative insights.

This tool is designed to bridge the gap between quantitative bibliometric mapping and in-depth qualitative interpretation, making it ideal for researchers looking to move beyond surface-level insights into thematic understanding.
